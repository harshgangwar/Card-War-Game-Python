# how to play "War", here are the basic rules:
#
# The deck is divided evenly, with each player receiving 26 cards, dealt one at a time,
# face down. Anyone may deal first. Each player places his stack of cards face down,
# in front of him.
#
# The Play:
#
# Each player turns up a card at the same time and the player with the higher card
# takes both cards and puts them, face down, on the bottom of his stack.
#
# If the cards are the same rank, it is War. Each player turns up three cards face
# down and one card face up. The player with the higher cards takes both piles
# (six cards). If the turned-up cards are again the same rank, each player places
# another card face down and turns another card face up. The player with the
# higher card takes all 10 cards, and so on.
#
# There are some more variations on this but we will keep it simple for now.
# Ignore "double" wars
